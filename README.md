# Developers-Quiz

## Description

- This project was built to further my understanding of using variables and JavaScript alike to write directly to the DOM and make the webpage even more responsive to user feedback and enhance user ability. Building this page also helped me obtain better knowledge of event listeners, data sets, and the time interval in JavaScript. It seemed to be a challenging task at first to build my first webpage that included links to a seperate HTML page but the challenge made it more intriguing and gave me more motivation to take on the task. Overall, the project helped solidify what I continue to learn throughout the course by doing my best to apply all the concepts that have been presented.
